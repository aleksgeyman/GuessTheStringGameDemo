# GuessTheStringGameDemo

Create a mastermind game:

•        At the start, generate a random string of 4 characters ranging from A to Z.

   Print out the random string on the console for convenience.

•        On the screen should be 4 boxes where the user can input a letter on each.

   Next to the boxes is a 'Check' button.

•        When the user presses the check button, the boxes should change color following these rules:

•        GREEN -> When the character is in the right spot ORANGE -> When the character is in the random string but not in the right spot RED -> When the character is not in the random string

•        The user has 1 minute to find the correct sequence, visualize the remaining time on screen

•        When there is no more remaining time, navigate to a new screen with a game over message and retry button

•        When the user entered the right sequence, navigate to a new screen with a success message and retry button

Make sure that the logic is testable
